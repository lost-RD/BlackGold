# BlackGold
A RimWorld mod that adds oil gushers, pumpjacks and barrels to fill with oil.

##Changelog

###v0.1:

* Added oil gushers that generate just before steam geysers and with the same settings. Did so by modifying MapGenerators.xml which probably makes it incompatible with other mods that modify the same file. Uses steam geyser sprite but I created a custom mote and sprayer.
* Added barrel table. Has recipe to make barrels (10 steel, 1000 work). Uses machining table sprite.
* Added pumpjack that can (only) be placed on oil gushers. Has recipe to create an oil barrel (1 empty barrel, 6666 work - still not enough? Unsure about balance here). Uses placeholder sprite, would be fantastic if anybody threw a better one together.
